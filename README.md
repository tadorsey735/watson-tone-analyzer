# watson-tone-analyzer API

Sends inputs over to IBM Watson's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html">Tone Analyzer</a>. Results are charted on bar graphs via <a href="https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/">Chartist</a>.

Credentials for the Watson API here don't work. To get your own, sign-up for free 30-day trial with IBM's Bluemix. Then, to get this app to work, replace the credentials in ./config/watson_creds.js with your own (once you have an account you can get the info you need <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/common/getting-started-credentials.html">here</a>).
